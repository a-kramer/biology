BioPSy
=========
BioPSy is a tool that performs parameter synthesis on biological models specified using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and corresponding time series data.  BioPSy utilises the Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver, dReal to determine the range of acceptable parameter values within a given domain.  A model using parameter sets computed with BioPSy is formally guaranteed to satisfy the desired behavior.
